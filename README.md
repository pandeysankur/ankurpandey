About Me 👋
Hi, I’m Ankur Pandey, a passionate and detail-oriented QA Engineer with 1.8+ years of experience in Manual and Automation Testing in the banking domain, My journey began in software testing with a strong foundation in functional testing, test automation, and API testing, and has steadily grown into a robust QA career path.

My educational background in Computer Applications (MCA) and certifications in ISTQB and CP-SAT have helped me build analytical and structured problem-solving skills, which I apply to real-world projects involving both manual and automated test design and execution.

I’m currently deepening my expertise in tools like Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, Cucumber BDD, Postman, and RestAssured, while exploring advanced concepts in API testing, framework design, and CI/CD integration using Jenkins and Git.
